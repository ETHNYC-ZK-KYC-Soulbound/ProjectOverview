# Soulbound NFT with ZK KYC

## Introduction

At ETH NYC, we're creating a soulbound NFT with ZK KYC information, so that dApps can distinguish which user has jurisdictionary right to use their platform. We achieve this without revealing any of user's actual KYC info, so that they can stay anonymous behind the ZK mechanism.

## Set up
